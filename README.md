### Course Recommender System
----------------------------------------

This project focuses on building a **course recommendation system** that suggests relevant courses based on similarity between course content.

#### Key Concepts Used
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization  
- Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between courses  

#### How It Works
1. Course-related text data is preprocessed and combined.
2. TF-IDF is applied to convert text into numerical vectors.
3. Cosine similarity is used to identify and rank similar courses.
4. The system returns the top recommended courses based on similarity scores.

This project demonstrates the core logic behind **content-based recommender systems** using data science and machine learning techniques.
